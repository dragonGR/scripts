# Alejandro's Script Vault
A repository featuring a collection of shell scripts tailored to streamline and automate my personal computing tasks. These scripts are designed to facilitate tasks such as setting up a fresh Arch Linux environment, compiling AOSP sources, and building the latest stable Linux kernel from source and more...

## About
My Vault provides a series of shell scripts crafted to simplify and enhance my own workflows. While these scripts are tailored specifically for my setup, you're welcome to configure and adapt them for your own use. The scripts are primarily designed for Arch-based environments but can be adjusted for other systems with minor modifications.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Arch Linux or an Arch-based distribution (obviously duh...)
- Required development tools and dependencies (git, make, gcc, clang)

## Usage
Each script is designed to be self-contained, with comments to guide you through its functionality. Please refer to the documentation within each script for detailed usage instructions. I include very detailed comments, not for others but for myself because sometimes I forget what I did with the code. So, I always leave comments to help my future self understand it. You feel me?
